Installing django using pip :
- pip install django

Installing database mysqlclient using pip :
# the requirements equipment before installing mysqliclient is to install below at first:
- sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev

- sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

- pip install pymysql

# Finally install mysqliclient that's supported python 3.5
pip install mysqlclient


Now we need to set up the databases that we already installed.

"""
A default Jinja2 environment for the rendering of html in print previews
and others.

The `loader` loads its templates from the camelot/art/templates
folder.  As it is a :class:`jinja2.loaders.ChoiceLoader` object, other
loaders can be appended or prepended to it :attr:`loaders` attribute, to
customize the look of the print previews or reuse the existing style

The `environment` is a :class:`jinja2.environment.Environment` which uses
the `loader` and that can be used with
the :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.print_preview.PrintJinjaTemplate` action
step.

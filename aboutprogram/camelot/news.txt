Development
-----------

 * A single source base for both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3

 * A single source base for both PyQt4 and PySide, see :ref:`faq-pyside`
 
 * The application itself is an action, :class:`camelot.admin.action.application.Application`.
   This makes it easy to customize the startup process by overwritting its `model_run` method.
  
 * Modified progress dialog to add and clear details while the action runs.
 
   .. image:: /_static/controls/progress_dialog_detail.png
 
 * Default sizes for forms are calculated, avoiding the need of setting the `form_size` attribute on the `Admin` class.
 
 * The `OneToMany` editor can display query attributes, created with `lazy='dynamic'`.
 
 * The `count` query no longer uses subselects, reducing the time needed to build
   up an initial table view on databases that are slow when handling subselects,
   such as MySQL.

 * New available actions :
 
   * Start and stop a profiler : :class:`camelot.admin.action.application_action.Profiler`.
   * Change authentication picture : :class:`camelot.admin.action.application_action.Authentication`.
 
 * New action steps :
 
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.item_view.OpenTableView`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.select_file.SaveFile`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.select_file.SelectDirectory`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.select_object.SelectObjects`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.gui.SelectItem`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.gui.SelectSubclass`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.application.MainWindow`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.form_view.ToFirstForm`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.form_view.ToLastForm`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.form_view.ToNextForm`
   * :class:`camelot.view.action_steps.form_view.ToPreviousForm`
 
 * Reworked import/export action to handle tables with many columns and allow the
   user to customize the imported and exported columns.
 
 * New database profiles api in :class:`camelot.core.profile.ProfileStore`
 
 * Integer and float editors display `None` as an empty string
 
 * The `list_action` state is used to determine the icon in a table view
 
 * Delayed primary key type definition in default models, so the default models
   can be used with other types of primary keys, such as UUID.

 * See :ref:`migrate-latest` for documentation on how to upgrade an 
   existing Camelot project to the latest version.
 
 * Tested with SQLAlchemy 1.0.8
 
 * Removed the `ColoredFloatDelegate` as it is not a basic type of editor
 
 * `nullable`, `visible`, `validator` are dynamic field attributes

 * `ObjectAdmin` does introspeciton on properties to see if they have a setter defined

 * `EntityAdmin` does introspection on hybrid attributes to look for default field attributes

 * `camelot.view.filters` module has been moved to :mod:`camelot.admin.action.list_filter`

 * Remove 'delete_mode' and 'save_mode' Admin attributes, as this behavour is customizable with actions.

 * Remove the 'search_all_fields' Admin attribute, as this behavour can is customizable with the `get_search_fields` method.

 * Add the `get_search_fields` method to the `EntityAdmin` for fine grained customization of the fields to search.
 
 * The tableview shows the number of selected rows.
